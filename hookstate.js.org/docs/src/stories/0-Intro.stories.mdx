# Creating and using global state

Let's start with an example, explanation after. No boilerplate - create the state and use it:

<PreviewSample example="global-getting-started" />

The state is created by calling `createStateLink`. The first argument is the initial state value.
The result value is an instance of `StateLink`,
which **can be** used directly to get and set the state value outside of a react component.

When you need to use the state in a functional `React` component,
pass the created state to `useStateLink` function
and use the returned result in the component's logic.
The returned result is an instance of `StateLink` too,
which **must be** used within a react component (during rendering
or in effects) and/or it's children components.

### Important notes

The `useStateLink` forces a component to rerender everytime, when:
* a segment/part of the state data is changed *AND only if*
* this segement was **used** by the component during or after the latest rendering.

For example, if your state value is `{ a: 1, b: 2 }` and
a component uses only `a` property of the state, it will rerender
only when the whole state object is updated or when `a` property is updated.
Setting the state value/property to the same value is also considered as an update.

You can create as many global states as you need.

A component can use one or many states,
i.e. you may call `useStateLink` multiple times for multiple states.

The same state can be used by multiple different components.

The `useStateLink` is a hook and should follow React's rules of hooks.

When you do not need the global state anymore, it should be destroyed by calling
`destroy()` method of the state link created by `createStateLink` function.
This is necessary for some plugins, which allocate native resources, like subscription to databases, broadcast channels, etc.
In most cases, a global state is used during whole life time of an application and would not require
destruction. However, if you have got, for example, a catalog of dynamically created and
destroyed stores, the states should be destroyed as advised above.

<Story name="Local state" ><br /></Story>

# Creating and using local state

When a state is used by only one component, and maybe it's children,
it is recommended to use *local* state instead of *global*.
Here `useStateLink` behaves similarly to `React.useState`, but the
returned instance of `StateLink` has got more features, which are covered in the following chapters
of the documentation.

<PreviewSample example="local-getting-started" />

### Important notes

Local state is automatically created by `useStateLink` when the first argument
is not an instance of `StateLink` (for instance, the result of `createStateLink`).

Local (per component state) is created when component is mounted
and automatically destroyed when a component is unmounted.

The same as for the global state, `useStateLink` forces a component to rerender when:
* a segment/part of the state data is changed *AND only if*
* this segement was **used** by the component during or after the latest rendering.
