# Creating and using global state

Because the API is concise and intuitive, we do not need many words to explain it. Examples do the best job telling the story. You do not need to read the documentation page by page. Feel free to jump to the page, which is relevant for your current problem. Examples in each section are self-contained and complete. So you can learn it in few minutes and focus on what is important for you at this stage.

Using the library in Typescript project makes it even simpler as type inference of the API functions supports any complexity of data structures of your states. Of course, you can also use it from a plain javascript.

Hookstate consists of the core package `@hookstate/core` and optional plugins `@hookstate/*`, which you may include when needed. We have got the goal to keep the core library as small as possible but still feature-rich to address most of problems in state management and provide with good foundation for plugins. Plugins extend the library and address more specific needs. You can also write your own plugins: it is easy and gives a lot of power.

So, let's start.
