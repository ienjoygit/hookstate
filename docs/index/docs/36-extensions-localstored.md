import { PreviewSample } from '../src/PreviewSample'

Simple extension which enables local storage persistence for a state.
- It works same way for local and global states
- An application can provide storage engine instance to allow for storing the data elsewhere. By default it stores it in a local browser storage.
- Setting a state to `none` will delete the persisted data from the storage.
