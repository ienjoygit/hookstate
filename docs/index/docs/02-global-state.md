## Creating and using global state

Create the state and use it within and outside a React component. Few lines of code. No boilerplate!

<PreviewSample example="global-getting-started" />

The state is created by [hookstate](typedoc-hookstate-core#hookstate). The first argument is the initial state value. The result value is an instance of [State](typedoc-hookstate-core#state),
which **can be** used directly to get and set the state value outside a React component.

When you need to use the state in a functional React component,
pass the created state to [useHookstate](typedoc-hookstate-core#usehookstate) function
and use the returned result in the component's logic.
The returned result is an instance of [State](typedoc-hookstate-core#state) too,
which **must be** used within a React component (during rendering
or in effects) and/or it's children components.

Read more about [hookstate](typedoc-hookstate-core#hookstate) and [useHookstate](typedoc-hookstate-core#usehookstate) in the [API reference](typedoc-hookstate-core).
