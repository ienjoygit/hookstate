Hookstate 2.0 and its plugins have been released. It is now simpler, smaller and faster state management library for React.

If you used Hookstate 1.x in your project, have a look into the list of [non-backward compatible changes](./migrating-to-v2).

If you are new to Hookstate, it is easy to [get started](./getting-started).

Enjoy!
